						for comparing objects.
NotEqual(expected, result) This method asserts that the result is not equal to the expected
outcome.

True(result) This method asserts that the result is true.

False(result) This method asserts that the result is false.

IsType(expected, result) This method asserts that the result is of a specific type.

IsNotType(expected, result) This method asserts that the result is not a specific type.

IsNull(result) This method asserts that the result is null.

IsNotNull(result) This method asserts that the result is not null.

InRange(result, low, high) This method asserts that the result falls between low and high.

NotInRange(result, low, high) This method asserts that the result falls outside low and high.

Throws(exception, expression) This method asserts that the specified expression throws a
